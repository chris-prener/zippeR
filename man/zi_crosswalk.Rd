\title{Crosswalk ZIP Codes with ZCTA Dictionary}
\usage{
zi_crosswalk(
  .data,
  input_zip,
  dict = "UDS 2021",
  dict_zip = "ZIP",
  dict_zcta = "ZCTA",
  style = "zcta5"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{An "input object" that is data.frame or tibble that contains
ZIP Codes to be crosswalked.}

\item{input_zip}{The column in the input data that contains five-digit ZIP
Codes. If the input is numeric, it will be transformed to character data
and leading zeros will be added.}

\item{dict}{A "dictionary object" that contains ZIP Code to ZCTA crosswalks.
This can either be an object in the user's global environment or,
alternatively, a string that corresponds to the vintage of UDS Mapper crosswalk
files to be used. Valid strings are formatted with \code{"UDS"} followed by
a year between 2010 and 2021 so that a complete input looks like
\code{dict = "UDS 2020"}. See \code{zi_load_crosswalk()} for additional
information and to preview these objects.}

\item{dict_zip}{The name of the column in the "dictionary object" that contains
ZIP Code data. This is \code{"ZIP"} by default, but can be changed optionally
to another name.}

\item{dict_zcta}{The name of the column in the "dictionary object" that contains
ZCTA data. This is \code{"ZCTA"} by default, but can be changed optionally
to another name.}

\item{style}{A character scalar - either \code{"zcta5"} or \code{"zcta3"}.}
