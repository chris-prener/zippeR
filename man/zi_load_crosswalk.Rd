\description{
Since USPS ZIP Codes are not identical to Census Bureau ZCTAs,
    data containing ZIP Codes should be crosswalked to identify the proper
    ZCTA. The American Academy of Family Physicians publishes open-source
    crosswalk files on their UDS Mapper website (\url{https://udsmapper.org/}).
    This function loads the crosswalk files
    (\url{https://udsmapper.org/zip-code-to-zcta-crosswalk/}) so that they
    can be previewed from within R.
